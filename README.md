#start the application 
1. First we must start 3 terminals in the "/jesusSoutoTrabe" folder.
2. In the first terminal we are going to start the authentication service. So we do "cd .\serverAuth\" and then "npm run start".
3. In the second terminal we are going to start the service. So we do "cd .\service\", "npm install nodemon" and then "npm run start".
4. And to finish in the third we do the same, "cd .\client\", "npm install nodemon" and then "npm run start".
5. The client url is http://localhost:4000/ . To run the application we have to put this url in the browser.
